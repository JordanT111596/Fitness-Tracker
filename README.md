Homework 17 by Jordan Triplett
Completed 09/23/2020

This assignment has us create a workout tracker to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day and to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, one can track distance traveled. This application uses a Node & Express backend to save and retrieve workout data from a MongoDB database file.

As specified in the assignment, one can view, create, and track daily workouts. One can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. One can track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, one can track distance traveled. Now get to those workouts!
